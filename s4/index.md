## ⚔️ ROUND 401: DUDE, WHERE'S MY SHIP?

### Brotherhood of Badoon + Goblin Nation\* + Extreme Risk + Standard III + Expert I (Base difficulty = ☆☆☆)

🚫 WHAT'S MISSING: **Ship Command** modular set is **REMOVED COMPLETELY!**

**👹 Goblin Nation\* modular set (cards from Mutagen Formula):** <br>
_(This modular set and its use in Brotherhood of Badoon is Astrodar's clever idea.)_

- 4x Goblin Thrall
- 4x Goblin Soldier
- Goblin Knight
- Monster
- Goblin Nation Side Scheme

**CONDITION 1:** Instead of using your regular hero-specfiic nemesis sets, assign each of the following to a hero as their nemesis set. The minion and side scheme in each of these sets is considered that set’s nemesis minion and nemesis side scheme, respectively.
> **Replacement nemesis sets:** Iceman's nemesis set, Badoon Headhunter

**CONDITION 2:** The **When Revelealed** text on **Drang III** is changed to the following:
> **When Revealed:** Discard the top 8 cards of the encounter deck. For each of the first 3 minions discarded this way, put it into play engaged with the player who is engaged with the fewest minions. If fewer than 3 minions come into play this way, search the encounter deck and discard pile for additional minions and put them into play the same way, repeating until 3 minions are in play from this entire When Revealed effect.

> **When Revealed (for any number of players):** Discard the top 4👤 cards of the encounter deck. For each of the first X = 1.5👤 (rounded up) minions discarded this way, put it into play engaged with the player who is engaged with the fewest minions. If fewer than X minions come into play this way, search the encounter deck and discard pile for additional minions and put them into play the same way, repeating until X minions are in play from this entire When Revealed effect.

> 2. Badoon Blitz side scheme (Galaxy’s Most Wanted campaign).
> 3. **Condition:** The Charge Up ability on the BADOON SHIP environment now reads “Then, if there are 3 or more barrage counters here,...” (instead of 4).
> 4. **Condition:** The Forced Response on the PURSUED BY THE PAST environment now reads “...if the number of counters here is at least 2 more than the number of players,...” (instead of 3).
> 5. The rest of the Ship Command modular set is not added.

## ⚔️ **ROUND 402: CROSSER BONES**

### Expert Crossbones + Deathstrike + Supersonic + Hounds + Standard III + Expert I (Base difficulty = ☆☆☆)

- **BLASTERS** (from Supersonic) 
- **1x ADAMANTIUM UPGRADES** (from Deathstrike)
- **AHAB'S ENERGY SPEAR** (from Hounds)

> ⚠️ **Special Rule**: The second copy of ADAMANTIUM UPGRADES is shuffled into the encounter deck

**CONDITION:** Instead of using your regular hero-specfiic nemesis sets, assign each of the following to a hero as their nemesis set. The minion and side scheme in each of these sets is considered that set’s nemesis minion and nemesis side scheme, respectively.
> **Replacement nemesis sets:** 🏹 Hawkeye Nemesis Set, 🏃 Running Interference


### 🏅 Difficulty Levels

| ☆ | Standard III + Crossbones I/II |  | 🛠️ Improved Condition Upgrade⁴ |

> 2. Attach the second copy of ADMANTIUM UPGRADES to Crossbones instead of shuffling it into the encounter deck.
> 3. Attach AHAB'S SPEAR to Crossbones.
> 4. Each player chooses one of the “Improved” Condition upgrades from the Rise of the Red Skull campaign (IMPROVED THWART UPGRADE, IMPROVED ATTACK UPGRADE, IMPROVED DEFENSE UPGRADE or IMPROVED RECOVERY UPGRADE) and starts with it in play. '
