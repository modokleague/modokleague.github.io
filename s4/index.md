> **New for Season 4: TWO rounds of mayhem instead of four!** *(Who doesn't want drafts to happen more often?)*
> <br>💀 Face **BROTHERHOOD OF BADOON** and **CROSSBONES** with crucial elements **MISSING** from each scenario!

## ⚔️ ROUND 401: DUDE, WHERE'S MY SHIP?

### Brotherhood of Badoon + Goblin Nation\* + Extreme Risk + Standard III + Expert I (Base difficulty = ☆☆☆)

🚫 WHAT'S MISSING: **Ship Command** modular set is **REMOVED COMPLETELY!**

**👹 Goblin Nation\* modular set (cards from Mutagen Formula):** <br>
_(This modular set and its use in Brotherhood of Badoon is Astrodar's clever idea.)_

- 4x Goblin Thrall
- 4x Goblin Soldier
- Goblin Knight
- Monster
- Goblin Nation Side Scheme

**CONDITION 1:** Instead of using your regular hero-specfiic nemesis sets, assign each of the following to a hero as their nemesis set. The minion and side scheme in each of these sets is considered that set’s nemesis minion and nemesis side scheme, respectively.
> **Replacement nemesis sets:** Iceman's nemesis set, Badoon Headhunter

**CONDITION 2:** The **When Revelealed** text on **Drang III** is changed to the following:
> **When Revealed:** Discard the top 8 cards of the encounter deck. For each of the first 3 minions discarded this way, put it into play engaged with the player who is engaged with the fewest minions. If fewer than 3 minions come into play this way, search the encounter deck and discard pile for additional minions and put them into play the same way, repeating until 3 minions are in play from this entire When Revealed effect.

> **When Revealed (for any number of players):** Discard the top 4👤 cards of the encounter deck. For each of the first X = 1.5👤 (rounded up) minions discarded this way, put it into play engaged with the player who is engaged with the fewest minions. If fewer than X minions come into play this way, search the encounter deck and discard pile for additional minions and put them into play the same way, repeating until X minions are in play from this entire When Revealed effect.


## ⚔️ **ROUND 402: CROSSER BONES**

### Expert Crossbones + Deathstrike + Supersonic + Hounds + Standard III + Expert I (Base difficulty = ☆☆☆)

**🚫 WHAT'S MISSING:** Experimental Weapons modular set is **REPLACED COMPLETELY** with the following cards (ordered from top to bottom during Setup):

- **HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES** (from Supersonic)
- **BLASTERS** (from Supersonic) 
- **1x ADAMANTIUM UPGRADES** (from Deathstrike)
- **AHAB'S ENERGY SPEAR** (from Hounds)

> ⚠️ **Special Rule**: The second copy of ADAMANTIUM UPGRADES is shuffled into the encounter deck

**CONDITION:** Instead of using your regular hero-specfiic nemesis sets, assign each of the following to a hero as their nemesis set. The minion and side scheme in each of these sets is considered that set’s nemesis minion and nemesis side scheme, respectively.
> **Replacement nemesis sets:** 🏹 Hawkeye Nemesis Set, 🏃 Running Interference
