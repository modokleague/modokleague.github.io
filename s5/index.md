> 🧲 **Replacement nemesis minion 1:** Put **Magneto 2.6 (Sci-Fi)** out of play and assign it to one of the heroes as their nemesis minion
> 🌋 **Replacement nemesis minion 2:** Put **Avalanche 9.0 (Sci-Fi)** out of play and assign it to the other hero as their nemesis minion
> ☄️ **Replacement nemesis side scheme:** Put the **ICE-Teroid M side scheme (Sci-Fi)** out of play. It is considered the nemesis side scheme for both heroes

**CONDITION 2:** The **When Revelealed** text on **The Sentinel Factory (1B)** main scheme is changed to the following:
> **When Revealed:** Choose one player to search the encounter deck for a copy of the Sentinel Mark V minion and reveal it. The other player searches the encounter deck for a copy of the Nimrod mion and reveals it. Shuffle the encounter deck.
