## ⚔️ ROUND 501: MOLDY OLDIES

### Master Mold + Sentinels + Future Past + Obligations and Attachments Encounter Set + No Magneto ally (Base difficulty = 4☆)

🚫 WHAT'S MISSING: Regular encounter and nemesis sets, plus the **Magneto ally** isn't showing up at difficulties of 4☆+

_(Inspired by Con of Heroes 2023 Challenge “Mark VII My Lunch” and a challenge Kakita Jamie brought to Con of Heroes 2025)_

**CONDITION 1:** Instead of using your regular hero-specfiic nemesis sets, assign the following minions and side scheme as the heroes nemesis minions and side scheme
> 🧲 **Replacement nemesis minion 1:** Put **Magneto 2.6 (Sci-Fi)** out of play and assign it to one of the heroes as their nemesis minion
> 🌋 **Replacement nemesis minion 2:** Put **Avalanche 9.0 (Sci-Fi)** out of play and assign it to the other hero as their nemesis minion
> ☄️ **Replacement nemesis side scheme:** Put the **ICE-Teroid M side scheme (Sci-Fi)** out of play. It is considered the nemesis side scheme for both heroes

**CONDITION 2:** The **When Revelealed** text on **The Sentinel Factory (1B)** main scheme is changed to the following:
> **When Revealed:** Choose one player to search the encounter deck for a copy of the Sentinel Mark V minion and reveal it. The other player searches the encounter deck for a copy of the Nimrod mion and reveals it. Shuffle the encounter deck.

### 🏅 Difficulty Levels

| ⭐ **Level** | 🂡 **Obligations and Attachments Encounter Set¹** |  **Villain Levels** | 🧲 **Magneto Ally²** | 🛠️ **Further Modifications** |
|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|:----------:|
| ★★★★★★ | ✅ | III/IV³ | 🚫 | 🚧 Nimrod's Portal + Stun Beam + Ignore Future Past Victory⁴ |
| ☆☆☆☆☆ | ✅ | II/III | 🚫 | 🚧 Nimrod's Portal + Stun Beam + Ignore Future Past Victory⁴ |
| ☆☆☆☆ | ✅ | II/III | 🚫 | |
| ☆☆☆ | ✅ | II/III | 🧲 | |
| ☆☆ | ✅ | II/III | 🧲 | 🎁 Role upgrades + Metro PD⁵ |
| ☆ | ✅ | I/II | 🧲 | 🎁 Role upgrades + Metro PD⁵ |

> 1. 🂡 The **Obligations and Attachments Encounter Set** is detailed in the next section.
> 2. 🧲 The **Magneto Ally** (Mutant Genesis 172B) is not added to the game at difficulties of 4☆+.
> 3. 🤖 Start on Master Mold III. When Master Mold III is defeated, advance to Master Mold IV (see image below). Master Mold IV is identical to Master Mold III except that it has 18 health per player, 4* Scheme and 5 Attack. As a reminder of the increased stats, slide a copy of the Inifinity Gauntlet or the Desparate side of Hope’s Captor attachment behind the villain, with the stat bonuses showing.
> 4. 🚧 Difficulty enhancements:
>    * **Condition:** Ignore the Victory keyword on all cards in the FUTURE PAST modular set, meaning they do not go to the victory display when defeated.
>    * **Setup:** After resolving the When Revealed effect on Main Scheme 1B, find a copy of the STUN BEAM attachment and attach it to the NIMROD ally.
>    * **Setup:** Find and reveal a copy of the NIMROD'S PORTAL side scheme.
> 5. 🎁 Hero benefits:
>    * **Setup:** Each player may start with any one role upgrade in play from the Mutant Genesis campaign. These role upgrades may be from the same or different roles.
>    * **Setup:** The players start with METRO P.D. support in play. This card is the back side of the FRIGHTENED POLICE side scheme (Mutant Genesis campaign card 1/5)


## ⚔️ ROUND 502: SOUPED-UP SINISTER

### Mister Sinister +  Flight/Telepathy/Super Strength + Armadillo + Sauron + Hope Summers + Treacherous Encounter Set (Base difficulty = 4☆)

🚫 WHAT'S MISSING: Regular encounter and nemesis sets + the Hope Summers ally as it appears in the Hope Summer modular set

_(Inspired by the Gene Hack Man Con of Heroes 2024 Challenge)_

**CONDITION 1:** Instead of using your regular hero-specfiic nemesis sets, assign SAURON to one hero as their nemesis minion and ARMADILLO to the other hero. These minions are included in the encounter deck built for this scenario and are not set aside like regular nemesis minions are. There are no nemesis side schemes for this scenario.

**CONDITION 2:** Replace the HOPE SUMMERS ally from the Home Summers modular set with a modified version of the basic HOPE SUMMERS ally used in deck building. This copy of HOPE SUMMERS gains the text "Setup. The first player controls Hope Summers. Hope Summers does not count against your ally limit. If Hope Summers leaves play, the players lose the game." Additionally, change the card cost to "-". See below for a modified version of this card.

> 1. 🂡 The **Treacherous Encounter Set** is detailed in the next section.
> 2. ♦️ Start on Mister Sinister III. When Mister Sinister III is defeated, advance to Mister Sinister IV (see image below). Mister Sinister IV is identical to Master Mold III except that he has 25 health per player, 4 Scheme and 3 Attack. As a reminder of the increased stats, slide a copy of the Inifinity Gauntlet or the Desparate side of Hope’s Captor attachment behind the villain, with the stat bonuses showing.
> 3. 📎 **Condition:** When you complete Main scheme 1B, resolve the When Revealed ability of the Stage 2 main scheme you are removing from the game before advancing to the random stage 2A. 
> 4. 🚧 **Setup:** Put the TELEPORTED AWAY side scheme into play. Put the ARMADILLO minion into play, engaged with one of the players. Put the SAURON minion into play engaged with the other player.
> 5. 🎁 The players start the game with two of the Next Evolution Campaign Environments in play (Team Assembled, Safehouse Established, Geared Up, Mission Prepped, Practiced Maneurvers and Prepared Defenses). You do not need to include the associated campaign minion or side scheme with any of these environments.
