### 🎯 Scoring

> 🏆 In this one-round season, your score = the highest-difficulty you defeat! <br>


## ⚔️ **ROUND DETAILS: MISTER NEGATIVE**

### Expert Mister Negative + Sinister Syndicate + Iron Spider's Sinister Six + Osborne Tech as an additional deck (see below) + Standard I + Expert I (Base difficulty = ☆☆☆)

**🛠️ OSBORNE TECH DECK:** As part of setup, shuffle the Osborne Tech encounter deck and set it aside, face down. This will be known as the Osborne Tech Deck:
- The Osborne Tech Deck has its own discard pile. When an Osborne Tech card is discared, it is placed in the Osborne Tech Discard. If the Osborne Tech Deck is ever empty, shuffle the Osborne Tech Discard back into the Osborne Tech Deck.
- At the start of each Player Phase, discard all Osborne Tech cards attached to the villain and then draw the top card of the Osborne Tech Deck and attach it to the villain.
- You can remove an Osborne Tech card from the villain using its printed Hero Action, and this will cause the card to go to the Osborne Tech Discard in the same way as if it was discarded at the start of the Player Phase.

**🔄 CONDITION: Modification to Demons Unleashed 1A (Main Scheme):** Change "Each player puts an Inner Demon minion (Demon Brute or Demon Swordsmen) into play engaged with them." to "Deal an Inner Demon minion (Demon Brute or Demon Swordsmen) to each player as a face-down encounter card."

### 🏅 Difficulty Levels

| ⭐ **Level** | 🂡 **Encounter Set** | 📋 **Conditions** |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ★★★★★★ | Standard I + Expert I | ⚔️ Negative's Sword¹<br>👤 Each minion put into play gains the Self-Teamwork² trait<br>🆚 Nemesis minions³<br>☢️ Mister Negative When Revealed:  encounter cards⁴ |
| ☆☆☆☆☆ | Standard I + Expert I | ⚔️ Negative's Sword¹<br>👤 The first minion put into play each phase gains the Self-Teamwork² trait<br>🆚 Nemesis minions³<br>☢️ Mister Negative When Revealed: encounter cards⁴ |
| ☆☆☆☆ | Standard I + Expert I | ⚔️ Negative's Sword¹<br>🆚 Nemesis minions³ |
| ☆☆☆ | Standard I + Expert I |  |  |
| ☆☆ | Standard I + Expert I | 🛠️ Osborne Tech is not used |
| ☆ | Standard I + Mister Negative I/II | 🛠️ Osborne Tech is not used |

> 1. ⚔️ During setup, before resolving any **When Revealed** effects on the villain, attach Negative's Sword to the villain
> 2. **👤 Self-Teamwork (trait):** After a minion with self-teamwork enters play and engages a player, it activates against the player it is engaged with. This is in addition to other game effects that would cause this minion to activate when it enters play (such as Quickstrike).
> 3. **🆚 Condition:** Each stage of Mister Negative gains the following text: "**When Revealed:** Find and deal each player's nemesis minion to them as a face-down encounter card." Based on setup order, these cards will be dealt to each player after the initial Inner Demons, and thus will be revealed during the villain phase after these Inner Demons.
> 4. **☢️ Condition:** Each stage of Mister Negative gains the following text: "**When Revealed:** Deal 1 face-down encounter card to each player."
